### 2.2 Serial Login

#### 2.2.1 Serial Login

**Description:**

+ **Serial port settings: baud rate 115200, data bit 8, stop bit 1, no parity bit, no flow control;**
+ **Serial terminal login as root user, no password, login without account**;
+ **Software: Windows PC requires Super Terminal; choose a familiar serial terminal software.**

Here is an example using Putty to explain how to configure the terminal:   
**Step 1:** Connect the development board and the PC using a serial cable, and verify the serial port number recognized by the computer through the “Device Manager”. The port number recognized by the computer should be considered as the accurate one;   
**Description:**

+ Two serial ports will be generated, and SERIAL-B is the debugging serial port on the Linux side.![Image](./images/OKMX8MPQSMARC_Linux_User_Manual/f74afcf5864f4206beb4f7fd381a03a9.png)

**Step 2:** Open and configure PuTTY; set the serial line to match the COM port of your computer with a baud rate of 115200.![Image](./images/OKMX8MPQSMARC_Linux_User_Manual/b20d8743bdab4355b9bed0f8f57c72ca.png)   
![Image](./images/OKMX8MPQSMARC_Linux_User_Manual/ee413bb0c9bb4bac98a0b37dd328d753.png)

**Step 3:** Turn on the power switch of the development board, and serial port print information will be output until "Welcome to forlinx ok-mx8mpq-smarc" appears, indicating that the boot process is complete. The system defaults to the root account with no password, so you do not need to enter any login information.

#### 2.2.2 Serial Login Common Problems

Common problem troubleshooting points for logging in using the serial port are as follows:

**Case 1:** No information is printed after the serial port is connected:

1. First, check whether the DIP switch is correct;
2. Re-open the serial port;
3. Change a serial port cable to test it;
4. If all of the above still does not work, check the status of the SoM's LED, if it is not a heartbeat light or does not light up, suspect that the system does not start normally, you need to check the system startup, or rewrite it!

**Case 2:** Command cannot be input after serial port is connected:

1. Re-open the serial port;
2. Replace the USB serial port cable with a new USB port on the computer, view the corresponding COM port in the device management, and reopen the serial port;
3. Replace a serial port cable.

**Case 3:** The port was not recognised by Device Manager:

1. Serial port driver is not installed. Try to install serial port driver.

### 2.3 Network Login Methods

#### 2.3.1 Network Connection Test

**Description:**

+ **The default factory IP of eth0 is 192.168. 0. 232 (carrier board GBE1 network port);**
+ **The computer and board should be on the same network segment for testing.**

Before login, ensure the network connection between the computer and the development board is normal, and use the ping command to test the connection status. The specific method of operation is as follows:

1. Connect the development board's GBE1 port to the computer using an Ethernet cable. Power on the board and boot the kernel. Confirm the blue heartbeat LED is blinking. Check the network card connection, ensuring its LED flashes rapidly. Once confirmed, proceed with testing the network connection.![Image](./images/OKMX8MPQSMARC_Linux_User_Manual/4cd7a79e2c504f43a042671339689520.png)

2\. Close the computer firewall (General computer operations, not described here in detail), then open the computer's run command.

**![Image](./images/OKMX8MPQSMARC_Linux_User_Manual/0ddb4a6af9e74c2da69a786786ff152d.png)**

3\. Use cmd to open the computer administrator interface, and use the ping command to test the network connection status of the computer and the development board.       

![Image](./images/OKMX8MPQSMARC_Linux_User_Manual/c52686a86ab84f85a682a667b78cb6b9.png)

The data is returned, and the network connection is normal.

#### 2.3.2 SSH server

**Description:**

+ **Default factory account root for SSH login with no password;**
+ **The default factory IP for eth0 (carrier board GBE1) is 192.168.0.232, and eth1 (carrier board GBE0) uses DHCP to obtain the IP;**
+ **File transfers can be performed with scp or sftp.**   
Plug the Ethernet cable into the GBE0 port on the carrier board to obtain the eth1 IP address.

Swap:              0           0           0
```

### 2.5 System Shutdown

In general, the power can be turned off directly, if there is data storage, function use and other operations, do not arbitrarily disconnect the power during the operation, in order to prevent irreversible damage to the file, you can only re-burn the firmware. To ensure the data is completely written, enter the sync command to synchronize the data before turning off the power.   
The command ‘reboot’ can be used to restart the development board. You can also restart the hardware by pressing the RESET key or directly power off and restart.   
Note: If the product designed by the user based on the core board has an abnormal system shutdown due to an accidental power loss in use, measures such as power-down protection can be incorporated into the design.

## 3. Platform Interface Function Use and Test

**Description:**

+ **Users should follow this section when using the screen with the QT file system, but can skip it for non- QT operations;**
+ **This chapter focuses on describing the functionalities in Qt. It is assumed that the default device is connected properly and the drivers are loaded correctly during testing. It is recommended to test the command line functionalities before testing the interface functionalities;**
+ **QT test program source code path:okmx8mp-smarc-appsrc.tar.zst**;
+ **Path to the test program in the development board file system: /usr/bin/fltest\_qt\_\***.

This chapter mainly explains the usage of the expansion interfaces on the development board in QT interface. The testing program is only for reference, and users need to make adjustments based on their actual situations when using it.

### 3.1 Introduction to Interface Function

The desktop is displayed as follows after the board is booted:![Image](./images/OKMX8MPQSMARC_Linux_User_Manual/fca276e19857485ea823ac2240733228.png)   
![Image](./images/OKMX8MPQSMARC_Linux_User_Manual/3fe290b781e24e7fa97a0a8790b0b7f5.png)**Note: Icon order may vary.**

### 3.2 Network Configuration Test

**Description:**

+ **By default, only the eth0 network interface (GBE1 port on the carrier board) is set to STATIC mode;**

+ **The set IP and other information will be saved to the relevant configuration file (/etc/systemd/network directory) of the system, so the network information set this time will be used every time the system is restarted.**   

  Icon![Image](./images/OKMX8MPQSMARC_Linux_User_Manual/e379b39da7af498591c0269c708f2e64.png)

   Clicking on the network configuration icon will open a interface program that supports two modes: STATIC and DHCP.

**STATIC Mode** 

After clicking on the network configuration icon, select the STATIC mode as shown in the figure. You can then configure the IP address, subnet mask, gateway, and DNS settings. Once you have set the parameters, click on "Apply and Restart Network".

| **Relevant Parameter**| **Meaning**
|----------|----------
| interface| 0 Set up the network card
| ip| Set the IP address
| netmask| Set the subnet mask
| gateway| Set up the gateway
| dns| Set DNS

![Image](./images/OKMX8MPQSMARC_Linux_User_Manual/4dd6869cddaf40d4a3705c0e49a53dec.png)

The DHCP mode interface is as follows:   
**Note: The test must be conducted under a router that can automatically assign IP addresses.**

Select DHCP, then choose the network card device to be configured in the "interface". Click "Apply and Restart Network" at the bottom of the interface, and the network will automatically restart and an IP address will be automatically obtained.   
![Image](./images/OKMX8MPQSMARC_Linux_User_Manual/53c9ce5ef90c4489aaa02ad4349714d5.png)Restart the development board, and you can see that the network configuration is in effect.   
**Note: If you configure eth0 with a static IP and eth1 with a dynamic IP simultaneously, it may cause routing abnormalities. If you encounter network connectivity issues, it is recommended to check the routing table. It is recommended to configure only one network port at a time.**

### 4.5 Watchdog Test

Watchdog is a frequently used function in embedded systems, and the device node for the watchdog in OK-MX8MPQ-SMARC is /dev/watchdog.   
Use fltest\_watchdog to start the watchdog, set the reset time to 10s, and feed the dog regularly. This command will turn on the watchdog and perform the dog-feeding operation, so the system will not reboot.

```plain
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# fltest_watchdog -t10 -c
Watchdog Ticking Away!
```

When ctrl + C is used to end the test procedure, the dog feeding is stopped, the watchdog is in the open state, and the system is reset after 10s; If you do not want to reset, please enter the command to close the watchdog within 10 seconds after the end of the program:

```plain
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# fltest_watchdog -d                      //Turn off the watchdog
```

Start the watchdog, set the reset time for 10s, and do not feed the dog. This command turns on the watchdog, but does not feed the dog, and the system restarts after 10 seconds.

```plain
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# fltest_watchdog -t10 -e
```

### 4.6 RTC Function Test

**Note: Ensure that button cell batteries are installed on the board and the battery voltage is normal.**   
RTC test: The main way to set the software and hardware time is by using the date and hwclock utilities. When performing the board power-down and power-up test, the software clock reads whether the RTC clock is synchronized or not.

```plain
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# date -s "2024-03-22 11:59:30"	           //Set the software time
Fri Mar 22 11:59:30 AM CST 2024
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# hwclock -w			           //Synchronize software time to hardware time
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# hwclock -r			                       //Display hardware time
2024-03-22 12:00:07.037836+08:00
```

Then power off and power on the development board, read the system time after entering the system, and you can see that the time has been synchronized.

```plain
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# date
Fri Mar 22 12:01:22 PM CST 2024
```

### 4.7 UART Test

OK-MX8MPQ-SMARC development board is equipped with 4 UART ports, which are labeled on the board as follows:

| **UART**| **Device Nodes**| **Description**
|----------|----------|----------
| UART3| ttymxc0| RS485 level, can be used for this test.
| UART1| ttymxc1| The debug serial port cannot be used for this test.
| UART0| ttymxc2| The Bluetooth interface cannot be used for this test.
| UART2| ttymxc3| The debug serial port cannot be used for this test.
| CH343USB| ttyCH343USB| RS485 level, can be used for this test.

The maximum baud rate supported by 485 is 4000000, supports parity check, CS5, CS6, CS7, CS8, and 1bit and 2bit stop bits.   
In this test, ttymxc0 and ttymxc2 are used to test the serial port by short-circuiting pins 1 and 4, pins 2 and 5, pins 3 and 6 of P27 respectively.

### 4.8 PCIE

Before powering up the system, insert the PCIE module into the PCIE card slot on the carrier board. After powering on and starting Linux, you can see that the corresponding device is enumerated successfully through lspci. Taking the Intel 82574L NIC as an example, the successful enumeration is shown below:

```plain
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# lspci
00:00.0 PCI bridge: Synopsys, Inc. DWC_usb3 / PCIe bridge (rev 01)
01:00.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation 82574L Gigabit Network Connection
```

Due to the many types of pcie devices, it may not be supported by the kernel by default, so you need to add the corresponding driver for the compiled device by yourself.

The terminal prints information about the USB flash drive, and since many types of USB flash drives exist, the information displayed may vary:   

1. After the development board starts up, insert the USB flash drive into the USB 3.0 port of the board.   
   Serial port information:

```plain

[  164.872657]  sda: sda1
[  164.875497] sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] Attached SCSI removable disk
```

2. Check the mount directory:

```plain
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# ls /run/media/
Boot-mmcblk2p1  sda1
```

sda1 is the first partition of the first connected USB storage device, and so on.  

3. View the contents of the USB flash drive.：：

```plain
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# ls -l /run/media/sda1
total 4096000
-rwxrwx--- 1 root disk 4194304000 Mar 22 16:34 test
```

4. Write test: Write speeds are limited by the specific storage device:

```plain
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# dd if=/dev/zero of=/run/media/sda1/test bs=100M count=40 \
conv=fsync oflag=direct
40+0 records in
40+0 records out
4194304000 bytes (4.2 GB, 3.9 GiB) copied, 197.547 s, 21.2 MB/s
```

5. Read test:   

**Note: To make sure the data is accurate, please restart the development board and test the reading speed.**

```plain

40+0 records out
4194304000 bytes (4.2 GB, 3.9 GiB) copied, 37.7027 s, 111 MB/s
```

6. Before removing the USB flash drive, it's necessary to unmount it using ''umount''.   

root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# umount /run/media/sda1  
**Note: Unplug the USB flash disk after exiting the mount path.**

#### 4.11.3 Micro-USB

Micro-USB can be used as the HOST side; for example, this is demonstrated by mounting a USB flash drive.   

1. After the development board starts, connect the USB flash drive to the Micro-USB port using a USB cable.   
   Serial port information:

```plain
[  109.407327] usb 1-1: new high-speed USB device number 2 using xhci-hcd
[  109.564425] usb-storage 1-1:1.0: USB Mass Storage device detected

[  110.597987] scsi 0:0:0:0: Direct-Access      USB      SanDisk 3.2Gen1 1.00 PQ: 0 ANSI: 6
[  110.607733] sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] 60125184 512-byte logical blocks: (30.8 GB/28.7 GiB)
[  110.616255] sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] Write Protect is off
[  110.621442] sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] Write cache: disabled, read cache: enabled, doesn't support DPO or FUA
[  110.645161]  sda: sda1
[  110.647846] sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] Attached SCSI removable disk
```

2. Check the mount directory:

```plain
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# ls /run/media/
Boot-mmcblk2p1  sda1
```

"sda1" represents the first partition of the first USB storage device inserted, and so forth. 

3. Write test: The write speed is limited by the specific storage device.

```plain
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# dd if=/dev/zero of=/run/media/sda1/test bs=100M count=40 \
conv=fsync oflag=direct
40+0 records in
40+0 records out
4194304000 bytes (4.2 GB, 3.9 GiB) copied, 283.871 s, 14.8 MB/s
```

4. Read the test:   

**Note: To make sure the data is accurate, please restart the development board and test the reading speed.**

```plain
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# dd if=/run/media/sda1/test of=/dev/null bs=100M iflag=direct
40+0 records in
40+0 records out
4194304000 bytes (4.2 GB, 3.9 GiB) copied, 131.639 s, 31.9 MB/s
```

```plain
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# umount /run/media/sda1
```

5. Before removing the USB flash drive, it's necessary to unmount it using ''umount''.   

**Note: Unplug the USB disk after exiting the mount path.**

The Micro-USB port can also be used as a device interface. To enable this, modify the dr\_mode of the usb\_dwc3\_0 node in the device tree to peripheral, then recompile the device tree, replace it on the development board, and reboot the board. After this, the board will function as a USB device.   
**Note: The otg function is not supported. You can only switch between the host side and the device side by modifying the device tree.**  
Insert an SD card into the SD card slot, and connect the development board’s Micro-USB port to the PC using a suitable USB cable. Make sure the SD card’s file system format is supported and recognized by the PC. Execute the following command:

```plain
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# insmod /lib/modules/`uname -a | awk '{print \
$3}'`/kernel/drivers/usb/gadget/legacy/g_mass_storage.ko removable=1 file=/dev/mmcblk1p1
[59133.219684] Mass Storage Function, version: 2009/09/11
[59133.224922] LUN: removable file: (no medium)
[59133.229373] LUN: removable file: /dev/mmcblk1p1
[59133.234021] Number of LUNs=1
[59133.237080] g_mass_storage gadget.0: Mass Storage Gadget, version: 2009/09/11

[59133.251568] g_mass_storage gadget.0: g_mass_storage ready
```

You can see that the PC mounts the SD card as a USB drive.

### 4.12 Ethernet Configuration

OK-MX8MPQ-SMARC has two Gigabit NICs on board, and when plugging in the network cable to connect to the network, eth0 is factory configured with the Gigabit NIC as static IP 192.168.0.232 by default. The network card of OK-MX8MPQ-SMARC can be configured through the configuration file /etc/systemd/network/10-eth.network.   
**Note: eth0 and eth1 are opposite to the silkscreen labels on the carrier board. eth0 corresponds to the GBE1 port on the carrier board, and eth1 corresponds to the GBE0 port.**

#### 4.12.1 Gigabit Ethernet Static IP Configuration

**Note: The Gigabit Ethernet cards in the kernel are eth0 and eth1, and the default IP of eth0 is 192.168.0.232.** 

 After the development board is powered on and started normally, execute the following command to open the network configuration file/etc/systemd/network/10-eth. network.

```plain
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# vi /etc/systemd/network/10-eth.network
```

Content as follows (slight differences may occur after software version updates; users should refer to actual information):

```plain
[Match]
Name=eth0
KernelCommandLine=!root=/dev/nfs

[Network]
Address=192.168.0.232/24
Gateway=192.168.0.1
DNS=114.114.114.114
```

Name is used to specify the network card with fixed IP; 

Address is used to specify the IP address to be fixed; 

Gateway is used to specify the gateway; 

DNS is used to specify the name resolution server.   
Set eth0 to get IP automatically, just delete /etc/systemd/network/10-eth.network. The 10-eth. network can also be modified to follow the 11-eth. network.   
/etc/systemd/network/11-eth.network is the configuration file that controls eth1 and is configured to obtain the IP automatically by default. You can modify 11-eth.network by referring to 10-eth.network and configure eth1 with a fixed IP address.

#### 4.12.2 Ethernet Speed Test

**Description:**

+ **Test the communication speed between the development board and the computer to ensure that they can communicate properly;**
+ **This test assumes iperf3 is pre-installed on Windows by default.**   

To test the network speed of OK-MX8MPQ-SMARC's eth1 interface, you can use the network speed testing tool iperf3.   
Run iperf3 in server mode from the cmd command terminal on Windows:

```plain
D:\iperf-3.1.3-win64\iperf-3.1.3-win64>iperf3.exe -s
```

![Image](./images/OKMX8MPQSMARC_Linux_User_Manual/7b398e50ab0d429ca1629c9add838679.png)Connect the network cable to the eth1 interface. After the system starts, eth1 will automatically obtain an IP address. Then, enter the following command in the OK-MX8MPQ-SMARC serial debugging terminal:

```plain

### 4.16 Play/Record Test

**Description:**   
**OK-MX8MPQ-SMARC provides 1 x 3.5mm audio jack and 2 x PH2.0 speaker connectors. The earphone mic and the carrier board mic correspond to the left and right channels of the recording, respectively. By default, the sound is played by the speakers, and after plugging in the headphones, it is switched to play by the headphones and mute the speakers.**

1. Use aplay to play audio 

Check the device number corresponding to the audio chip NAU88C22:

```plain
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# aplay -l
**** List of PLAYBACK Hardware Devices ****
card 0: audiohdmi [audio-hdmi], device 0: i.MX HDMI i2s-hifi-0 [i.MX HDMI i2s-hifi-0]
  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
card 1: nau88c22audio [nau88c22-audio], device 0: HiFi nau8822-hifi-0 [HiFi nau8822-hifi-0]
Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
card 1: nau88c22audio [nau88c22-audio], device 1: HiFi-ASRC-FE (*) []
  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
```

As above, when playing, the device corresponding to nau88c88 is card1, and either device0 or device1 can be used. (The equipment number may be different in actual use) 

 Playback test:

```plain
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# aplay -D hw:1,0 -f cd /home/forlinx/audio/30s.wav
```

2. Use the gstreamer playback audio device to view the available sound cards

```plain
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# pactl list sinks
Sink #0
        State: SUSPENDED
        Name: alsa_output.platform-sound-hdmi.stereo-fallback
......
Sink #1
        State: SUSPENDED
        Name: alsa_output.platform-sound-nau88c22.stereo-fallback
......
```

Set nau88c22 as the default sound card for playback

```plain
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# pactl set-default-sink 1
```

Video play

```plain
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# gst-play-1.0 /home/forlinx/audio/30s.mp3
```

Pressing the up and down keys on the keyboard adjusts the volume level, while the left and right keys control fast-forwarding or rewinding. The spacebar is used to start or pause playback.

3. Recording Test   

Check the device number corresponding to the audio chip NAU88C22:

```plain
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# arecord -l
**** List of CAPTURE Hardware Devices ****
card 1: nau88c22audio [nau88c22-audio], device 0: HiFi nau8822-hifi-0 [HiFi nau8822-hifi-0]
  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
card 1: nau88c22audio [nau88c22-audio], device 1: HiFi-ASRC-FE (*) []
  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
```

As mentioned, the device corresponding to nau88c88 is card1, device0. (**Note: In actual use, the device numbers may vary.**)

```plain
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# arecord -D hw:1,0 -c2 -f cd -d 10 mic.wav
Recording WAVE 'mic.wav' : Signed 16 bit Little Endian, Rate 48000 Hz, Stereo
```

-c2, dual channel 

 -f cd, 16 bit little endian, 44100, stereo 

 -d10, record for 10 second 

The default recording will capture the headphone mic and the carrier board mic as the left and right channels of the recording respectively.

### 4.17 Closing the Desktop

```plain
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# systemctl stop matrix                      //Turn off the desktop
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# systemctl start matrix                      //Turn on the desktop
```

### 4.18 LED Test

The OK-MX8MPQ-SMARC SoM has a controllable blue LED light. When the board is powered on, the blue LED light will blink.   
The testing method is as follows:   

1. To view trigger conditions:

```plain
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# cat /sys/class/leds/heartbeat/trigger
none rc-feedback rfkill-any kbd-scrolllock kbd-numlock kbd-capslock kbd-kanalock kbd-shiftlock kbd-altgrlock kbd-ctrllock kbd-altlock kbd-shiftllock kbd-shiftrlock kbd-ctrlllock kbd-ctrlrlock mmc0 mmc1 mmc2 timer oneshot [heartbeat] gpio cpu cpu0 cpu1 cpu2 cpu3 cpu4 cpu5 default-on rfkill0 bluetooth-power hci0-power rfkill1
```

Where \[heartbeat] indicates that the current trigger condition is the system heartbeat light. Write the above string in trigger to modify the trigger condition.   

2. User Control When the led trigger condition is set to none, the user can control the on and off of the led lamp through the command:

```plain
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# echo none > /sys/class/leds/heartbeat/trigger
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/heartbeat/brightness
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/heartbeat/brightness
```

3. Change the LED light to heartbeat light

```plain
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# echo heartbeat > /sys/class/leds/heartbeat/trigger
```

At this time, the LED light becomes a heartbeat light.

### 4.19 SQLite3 Test

### 4.22 SPI Test

2 x SPI buses are led out form the OK-MX8MPQ-SMARC carrier board, which are connected to flash w25q128fw.   
The following are the read and write tests for the two flashes respectively.   

1. Read qspi flash

```plain
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# dd if=/dev/urandom of=./test bs=100k count=1 conv=fsync oflag=direct
1+0 records in
1+0 records out
102400 bytes (102 kB, 100 KiB) copied, 0.003907 s, 26.2 MB/s
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# dd if=./test of=/dev/mtdblock0 bs=100k count=1 conv=fsync oflag=direct
1+0 records in
1+0 records out
102400 bytes (102 kB, 100 KiB) copied, 0.612079 s, 167 kB/s
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# dd if=/dev/mtdblock0 of=./test2 bs=100k count=1 conv=fsync iflag=direct 
1+0 records in
1+0 records out
102400 bytes (102 kB, 100 KiB) copied, 0.0080315 s, 12.7 MB/s
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# md5sum test test2
76910dd75b6a88bff3ac4a303815f939  test
76910dd75b6a88bff3ac4a303815f939  test2
```

The identical MD5 values indicate that the data written to the QSPI flash matches the data read out.   

2. Read and write spi flash

```plain
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# dd if=./test of=/dev/mtdblock1 bs=100k count=1 conv=fsync oflag=direct
1+0 records in
1+0 records out
102400 bytes (102 kB, 100 KiB) copied, 0.874812 s, 117 kB/s
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# 
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# dd if=/dev/mtdblock1 of=./test3 bs=100k count=1 conv=fsync iflag=direct 
1+0 records in
1+0 records out
102400 bytes (102 kB, 100 KiB) copied, 0.0630821 s, 1.6 MB/s
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# 
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# md5sum test test3

76910dd75b6a88bff3ac4a303815f939  test3
```

The MD5 values are the same, indicating that the data written into the SPI flash is consistent with the data read out.

### 4.23 GPIO

The GPIO on the OK-MX8MPQ-SMARC carrier board are extended via an I2C-to-GPIO chip.   
The GPIO on P32 are extended through chip5, and the GPIO on P34 are extended through chip6.   
![Image](./images/OKMX8MPQSMARC_Linux_User_Manual/50646b9387fa4ef484fb9b269e0586d5.png)  
![Image](./images/OKMX8MPQSMARC_Linux_User_Manual/9fbcc41185584f10b3d61017d64249f5.png)  
You can see both chips via a command.

```plain
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# gpiodetect 
gpiochip0 [30200000.gpio] (32 lines)
gpiochip1 [30210000.gpio] (32 lines)
gpiochip2 [30220000.gpio] (32 lines)
gpiochip3 [30230000.gpio] (32 lines)
gpiochip4 [30240000.gpio] (32 lines)
gpiochip5 [0-0023] (24 lines)
gpiochip6 [5-0022] (24 lines)
```

Use the gpioset command to set the output level (high or low) of a GPIO.   
The command format is: gpioset -C chipindex \< line = value > 

The chipindex is set to the specific chip serial number, the line is set to the gpio serial number under the chip, and the value is set to the output level.   

1. Set GPIO on chip 5   
   The pins are connected as follows:![Image](./images/OKMX8MPQSMARC_Linux_User_Manual/a4a8701b93d348ce9b36a5ba5ef4d134.png)Take the setting of GPIO7 as an example. GPIO7 is the GPIO20 \_ EXP on the SoM TCA6424IO expansion chip, and the chip is mounted on I2C1. So the corresponding chipindex is 5; the line is calculated as tens digit of the sequence number × 8 + units digit. For GPIO20\_EXP, the line is 2 × 8 + 0 = 16.   
   To set GPIO7 to output a high level:

```plain
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# gpioset -c 5 16=1
```

To set GPIO7 to output a low level:

```plain
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# gpioset -c 5 16=0
```

2. Set gpio of chip6. 

 Set GPIO P15 OUT as an example, chipindex = 6; line = 1 \* 8 + 5 = 13.   
To set GPIO P15 OUT to output a high level:

```plain
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# gpioset -c 6 13=1
```

To set GPIO P15 OUT to output a low level:

```plain
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# gpioset -c 6 13=0
```

### 4.24 Sleep Wake-up Test

The OK-MX8MPQ-SMARC platform supports sleep wake-up, currently supports serial wake-up, supports pwr key wake-up, and supports gpio wake-up   
Enable serial port wake-up:

```plain
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# echo enabled > /sys/class/tty/ttymxc1/power/wakeup
```

Sleep:

```plain
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# echo mem > /sys/power/state

The system can also be woken up by a short press of the carrier board Power key or the K3 key.。

### 4.25 IPv6 Test

The OK-MX8MPQ-SMARC platform supports IPv6 on the Ethernet port. The test commands are as follows:

```plain
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# ping ipw.cn
PING ipw.cn(2408:8719:3000:a:41::18 (2408:8719:3000:a:41::18)) 56 data bytes

64 bytes from 2408:8719:3000:a:41::18 (2408:8719:3000:a:41::18): icmp_seq=2 ttl=57 time=16.0 ms
```

## 5\. Multimedia Test

Some application layer software for audio and video on the OK-MX8MPQ-SMARC platform uses Gstreamer, which supports hardware codecs. All examples in this section based on the GStreamer command line form. If users need a player with an interface, they can also use qt's multimedia classes, which also support codecs, see the Qt Tests chapter.

The OK-MX8MPQ-SMARC platform has an internal video processing unit, the VPU, which supports hard codecs for video in the following formats:   
Video Decoding: H264, H265, VP8, VP9，maximum support 1080p 60fps  
Video Encoding： H264, H265; maximum support 1080p 60fps.

Table of hardware codec parameters for the OK-MX8MPQ-SMARC platform:

| Video Decoder| Format| Profile| Resolution| Frame rate| Bitrate
|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------
| | HEVC| main/main 10| 1920x1080| 60 fps| 160Mbps
| | H.264| HP/MP/BP| 1920x1080| 60 fps| 60Mbps
| | VP9| Profile 0,2| 1920x1080| 60 fps| 100Mbps
| | VP8| \-| 1920x1080| 60 fps| 60Mbps
| Video Encoder| H.264| HP/MP/BP| 1920x1080| 60 fps| 60Mbps
| | H265| \-| 1920x1080| 60 fps| 60Mbps

### 5.1 Audio and Video Playback

1. Use the Gplay player

Gplay is an audio - video player implemented based on Gstreamer. It can automatically select appropriate plugins for audio - video playback according to the hardware. It is also very simple to run；

```plain
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# gst-play-1.0 /home/forlinx/video/1080p_60fps_h264-30S.mp4
```

2. Use gst - launch to play audio and video

gst - launch is a commonly used debugging tool for developers during the development phase. Compared with Gplay, it is more flexible, but of course, it is also relatively more complicated to use.

```plain
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# gst-launch-1.0 filesrc location=/home/forlinx/audio/30s.mp3 ! id3demux ! queue ! mpegaudioparse ! decodebin ! audioconvert ! audioresample ! pulsesink
```

Play video only:

```plain
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# gst-launch-1.0 filesrc location=/home/forlinx/video/1080p_60fps_h264-30S.mp4 typefind=true ! video/quicktime ! aiurdemux ! queue max-size-time=0 ! vpudec ! imxvideoconvert_g2d ! video/x-raw, format=RGB16, width=1024, height=600 ! waylandsink
```

Play audio and video simultaneously:

```plain
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# gst-launch-1.0 filesrc location=/home/forlinx/video/1080p_60fps_h264-30S.mp4 typefind=true ! video/quicktime ! aiurdemux name=demux demux. ! queue max-size-buffers=0 max-size-time=0 ! vpudec !  imxvideoconvert_g2d ! video/x-raw, format=RGB16, width=1024, height=600 ! waylandsink demux. ! queue max-size-buffers=0 max-size-time=0 ! decodebin ! audioconvert ! audioresample ! pulsesink
```

### 5.2 Video Hardware Encoding

OK-MX8MPQ-SMARC supports video encoding in H264, H265 formats up to 1080p 60fps.   

1. H.264 Hardware Encoding                                         

Encode the YUV420 format video into H264 format video, and use videotestsrc as the data source:

```plain
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# gst-launch-1.0 videotestsrc num-buffers=300 ! "video/x-raw,format=YUY2,width=1920,height=1080,framerate=60/1" ! vpuenc_h264 ! queue ! h264parse ! qtmux ! filesink location=yuv2h264.mp4
```

Play encoded H264 video:

```plain
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# gst-play-1.0 yuv2h264.mp4 
```

You can see the video playing on the screen.   

2. H.265 Hardware Encoding                                      

Encode YUV420 video to H.265 format video:

```plain
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# gst-launch-1.0 videotestsrc num-buffers=300 ! "video/x-raw,format=YUY2,width=1920,height=1080,framerate=60/1" ! vpuenc_hevc ! queue ! h265parse ! qtmux ! filesink location=yuv2h265.mp4
```

Play encoded H265 video:

```plain
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# gst-launch-1.0 filesrc location=yuv2h265.mp4 ! qtdemux ! queue ! vpudec ! waylandsink
```

You can see the video playing on the screen.

+ Video Rotation

When performing video color space conversion, imxvideoconvert\_g2d only supports converting videos of other formats to RGB format.

1. Video color space conversion  
   Convert the built-in NV12 format video source of gstreamer to RGB16 format video:

```plain
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# gst-launch-1.0 videotestsrc ! video/x-raw,format=NV12 ! imxvideoconvert_g2d ! video/x-raw,format=RGB16 ! waylandsink
```

2. After decoding the h264 video, use imxvideoconvert \_ g2d to convert it to RGB16 video:

```plain
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# gst-launch-1.0 filesrc location=/home/forlinx/video/1080p_60fps_h264-30S.mp4 ! qtdemux ! queue ! h264parse ! vpudec ! imxvideoconvert_g2d ! video/x-raw, format=RGB16, width=1920, height=1080 ! waylandsink
```

The way of color space conversion after video decoding in other formats is the same, which is not repeated here.   

3. Video scaling (adjust the resolution of the video) Convert the gstreamer's own NV12 format 1280 \* 720 video source to RGB16 format 640 \* 480 video:

```plain
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# gst-launch-1.0 videotestsrc ! video/x-raw,format=NV12,width=1280,height=720 ! imxvideoconvert_g2d ! video/x-raw, format=RGB16, width=640, height=480 ! waylandsink
```

4. Video rotation  

Rotate the built-in video source of gstreamer by 90 degrees:

```plain
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# gst-launch-1.0 videotestsrc ! imxvideoconvert_g2d rotation=1 ! waylandsink
```

5. Rotate the video source that comes with gstreamer by 180 degrees:

```plain
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# gst-launch-1.0 videotestsrc ! imxvideoconvert_g2d rotation=2 ! waylandsink
```

### 5.5 Video Compositing

OK-MX8MPQ-SMARC uses the imxcompositor \_ g2d component for video compositing. It uses hardware acceleration for video compositing. It can only output video in RGB format.   

1. Combine two gstreamer's own video sources into one:

```plain
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# gst-launch-1.0 imxcompositor_g2d name=comp sink_1::xpos=160 sink_1::ypos=480 ! glimagesink videotestsrc ! comp.sink_0 videotestsrc ! comp.sink_1
```

2. Combine two gstreamer's own video sources into one, using a red background color:

```plain
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# gst-launch-1.0 imxcompositor_g2d background=0x000000FF name=comp sink_1::xpos=160 sink_1::ypos=480 ! glimagesink videotestsrc ! comp.sink_0 videotestsrc ! comp.sink_1
```

3. Combine two gstreamer's own video sources into one, using CSC, resize, and rotate:

```plain
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# gst-launch-1.0 imxcompositor_g2d name=comp sink_0::width=640 sink_0::height=480 sink_1::xpos=160 sink_1::ypos=500 sink_1::width=640 sink_1::height=480 sink_1::rotate=1 ! video/x-raw,format=RGB16 ! glimagesink videotestsrc ! video/x-raw,format=NV12,width=320,height=240 ! comp.sink_0 videotestsrc ! video/x-raw,format=I420,width=320,height=240 ! comp.sink_1
```

4. Combine three gstreamer native video sources into one, using CSC, resize, rotate, alpha, z-order, and maintaining the aspect ratio:

```plain
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# gst-launch-1.0 imxcompositor_g2d name=comp sink_0::width=640 sink_0::height=480 sink_0::alpha=0.5 sink_0::z-order=3 sink_1::alpha=0.8 sink_1::z-order=2 sink_1::xpos=160 sink_1::ypos=120 sink_1::width=640 sink_1::height=480 sink_1::rotate=1 sink_2::xpos=320 sink_2::ypos=240 sink_2::width=500 sink_2::height=500 sink_2::alpha=0.6 sink_2::keep-ratio=true ! video/x-raw,format=RGB16 ! glimagesink videotestsrc ! video/x-raw,format=NV12,width=320,height=240 ! comp.sink_0 videotestsrc ! video/x-raw,format=I420,width=320,height=240 ! comp.sink_1 videotestsrc ! video/x-raw,format=RGB16,width=320,height=240 ! comp.sink_2
```

### 5.6 NPU Test

The OK-MX8MPQ-SMARC development board is equipped with an iMX8MPLUS processor, which integrates an NPU with a computing power of up to 2.3 TOPS inside the CPU.   

TensorFlow Lite testing  
Demo recognizes information such as people, animals, plants, and places in the input image (grace\_copper. bp).

## 6. System Settings

### 6.1 Updating Logo

The OK-MX8MPQ-SMARC platform has two types of logo displays: U-Boot display and Weston display.   

1. The logo under uboot displays:   
   Currently, uboot supports mipi display and LVDS display, but does not support HDMI display. The method to replace the logo displayed under uboot is as follows: replace the picture in/run/media/Boot-mmcblk2p1 after the development board is started, and replace the MIPI screen with 1024x600 resolution 

​      Logo-1024x600.bmp, LVDS screen 1280x800 resolution replaces logo-1280 x800.bmp.   

2. Weston's logo shows:   
   The principle of Weston's logo display is to replace the background of Weston with the logo image, modify the weston configuration file /etc/xdg/weston/weston.ini, replace background-image=/home/forlinx/logo/logo-1920x1080.png with the user's logo path.

### 6.2 Self-starting Program Settings

Forlinx has preset the boot script/etc/autorun. sh through systemd, and this script will run automatically after booting. Users can modify this script to implement the application boot self-start function.   
Users can also set up a new systemd service to realize the automatic startup function of the application.

### 6.3 EEPROM Test

The FET-MX8MPQ-SMARC SoM integrates an EEPROM with a capacity of 32KB. The space allocation in the EEPROM is shown in the following table:

| Initial Address| Size| Content
|----------|----------|----------
| 0x0| 0x80| Header
| 0x80| 0x380| Board Config
| 0x400| 0x5000| DDR Param
| 0x5400| 0x400| Forlinx Reserved
| 0x5800| 0x2800| UserData

**Note: Please do not modify the data offset before 0x5800 in EEPROM, or it may cause the failure of uboot startup.**

Board Config stores the mac addresses of the two network ports, and the default mac address is calculated based on the CPUID.   In the EEPROM, 10KB space is reserved for the user, and the user can read and write the data in the UserData through the eep \_ getuserdata () and the eep \_ setuserdata (). There are examples in the okmx8mp \_ smarc. c file.

### 6.4 Starting the Watchdog Under Uboot

UBoot environment supports watchdog function. By default, the watchdog is not enabled. It can be activated by setting the following environment variables to initiate the watchdog’s default startup. Alternatively, the watchdog’s default startup can also be configured by modifying the device tree or the code.

```plain
u-boot=> setenv wdt_start 1
u-boot=> setenv wdt_timeout 10
u-boot=> saveenv
Saving Environment to MMC... Writing to MMC(2)... OK
```

Afterward, restart the board and you can see the following print in the startup printout, indicating that the watchdog has started:

```plain
WDT:   Started watchdog@30280000 with servicing every 1000ms (10s timeout)
```

After starting the watchdog, there is dog feeding under the uboot, so the watchdog reboot will not be triggered under uboot. After uboot starts the kernel, if the kernel does not reinitialize the watchdog or feed the watchdog, the watchdog will restart the system after 10 seconds.   
The default device tree for OK-MX8MPQ-SMARC reinitializes the watchdog.

### 6.5 Kernel and Device Tree Loading via Uboot

OK-MX8MPQ-SMARC supports data transfer via TFTP under uboot. Supports ethernet@30be0000 (GBE1 port on the baseboard) and ethernet@30bf0000 (GBE0 port on the baseboard). Please select the appropriate port according to the actual network cable connection.   
A common application scenario is to load the kernel and device tree through TFTP. Please set up the TFTP server in advance. The reference command is as follows:

```plain
u-boot=> setenv ethact ethernet@30be0000
u-boot=> setenv gatewayip 192.168.1.1
u-boot=> setenv ipaddr 192.168.1.166

### 6.6 Display Settings

The OK-MX8 MPQ-SMARC has 4 x display interfaces (DSI0, LVDS0, LVDS1, HDMI).   
According to the SMARC protocol specification, DSI0 and LVDS0 share a set of channels and can only use one peripheral at a time. In order to fully verify the peripheral performance of the CPU, the OK-MX8 MPQ-SMARC development board separates the DSI0 signal from the LVDS0 signal through a Switch chip U18, which can be used to verify their respective peripherals.   
At present, OK-MX8MPQ-SMARC can be multiplexed into DSI0 or LVDS0 display channels through LVDS0 \_ TX0 signal. On the SoM, switch between the two interfaces by modifying the resistor (see the hardware manual of the SoM for details). On the carrier board, switch between the two interfaces by using the S5 switch. Therefore, the display of OK-MX8MPQ-SMARC can be divided into two groups of modes.   
mode1, DSI0, LVDS1 Different display on three screens.   
mode2: LVDS0 and LVDS1 display together, HDMI display differently.   
MIPIDSI0 is currently configured with a resolution of 1024x600 and supports a maximum resolution of 2560x1440.   
Both LVDS0 and LVDS1 are currently configured at 1280x800 and support a maximum resolution of 1366x768.   
The maximum resolution supported by HDMI is 3840x2160.

#### 6.6.1 Dual LVDS Display Configuration

The OK-MX8MPQ-SMARC supports merging 2 x 4lanes LVDS displays into a single 8lanes dual-channel LVDS display, where the two channels output odd and even pixels respectively, with a maximum resolution of 1920×1080.   
To enable dual-channel LVDS, you need to modify the fsl,duplicate-channel attribute in the device tree to fsl,dual-channel, and modify the panel-timing of lvds0\_panel to match the timing of the new screen. fsl,duplicate-channel is used to output the data from LVDS0 to LVDS1 simultaneously, to realise the dual-screen heterodyne display. Enabling the “fsl,dual-channel” property activates the SPLIT mode for LVDS, with LVDS0 and LVDS1 channels outputting the odd and even pixels of the same display image respectively.   
There is a pre-configured device tree file in the kernel, named ok-mx8mp-smarc-lvds8lanes.dts, available for reference.

### 6.7 Separate Compilation of U-Boot and Kernel

The OK-MX8MP-SMARC uses Yocto for compilation by default, but U-Boot, the kernel, and other components can also be compiled separately.   
Uboot ：  
config：okmx8mp-smarc\_defconfig  
Cross-compilation：aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc  
Arch：arm

Kernel：   
Config：ok-mx8mp-smarc\_defconfig  
Dts：ok-mx8mp-smarc.dts、ok-mx8mp-smarc-2gb.dts  
Cross-compilation：aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc  
Arch：arm64

## 7. System Flashing

The OK-MX8MPQ-SMARC development board currently supports USB flashing via the UUU tool, and also supports flashing via a TF card. The appropriate flashing tool is provided in the user documentation.

#### 7.1 Image Required for Flashing

Image Path: 02-User Profile\\01-Software Profile\\03-Mirror \& Source Code\\01-Mirror File

| ok-mx8mp-smarc.dtb| This is the device tree used for development boards equipped with 4GB DDR.
| ok-mx8mp-smarc-2gb.dtb| This is the device tree used for development boards equipped with 2GB DDR.

The files ok8mp - linux - fs.sdcard.a\* are obtained after splitting ok8mp - linux - fs.sdcard. The purpose is to avoid bugs caused by some file systems not supporting overly large files. Combine ok8mp-linux- fs. sdcard. a \* to get ok8mp-linux- fs. sdcard. ok8mp-linux-fs.sdcard is the complete file system from the eMMC. Please note the distinction between ok8mp-linux-fs.sdcard, which is the merged file, and ok8mp-linux-fs.sdcard.a\*, which are the split files.   
The reference commands for merging ok8mp-linux-fs. sdcard. a \* under Linux system are as follows:

```plain
root@5d90dd71f33a:~# cat ok8mp-linux-fs.sdcard.a* > ok8mp-linux-fs.sdcard

### 7.4 Flashing Uboot in File System

Currently, U-Boot can only be flashed to the SPI flash via the file system and does not support OTG flashing.

#### 7.4.1 Flashing Uboot to SPIFLASH

Copy the U-Boot image to the /home/root/ directory of the development board. Then, execute the following command to flash the U-Boot image (ok-mx8mp-uboot.bin) to the SPI flash.

```plain
root@ok-mx8mpq-smarc:~# dmesg  | grep spi

```

The uboot is flashed to spiflash, and no offset.

### 7.5 Flashing via TF Card

#### 7.5.1 Making Flashing Card

Please use a TF card with a capacity of 16GB or above to make a flashing card.   
Two steps are required to make a flashing card:   

1. Re-partition the TF card, reserve enough space for uboot image and environment variables in front of the 0 partition, reserve enough space for flashing image in the 0th partition, and format the 0 partition into vfat format. For example, if the device node of the TF card is /dev/mmcblk1, the reference commands are as follows:   
   Clean up the partition table and possible environment variables.

```plain
root@5d90dd71f33a:dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/mmcblk1 bs=1M count=100 conv=fsync
```

Replug the TF card and create a new partition table.

```plain
root@5d90dd71f33a:fdisk /dev/mmcblk1 << EOF
n
p
1
16384

w
EOF
```

Format the partition

```plain
root@5d90dd71f33a:mkfs.vfat -F 32 -n "boot" /dev/mmcblk1p1
```

2. Flash the U-Boot image to the position with an offset of 32KB on the TF card. For example, if the device node of the TF card is /dev/mmcblk1, the reference commands are as follows:

```plain
root@5d90dd71f33a:dd if=ok-mx8mp-uboot.bin of=/dev/mmcblk1 bs=1K seek=32 conv=fsync
```

The flashing card is made and next you need to copy the image to the flashing card.

#### 7.5.2 Copying the Required Image to The Flashing Card

Copy ok-mx8mp-uboot.bin, ok8mp-linux-fs.sdcard.a\*, Image, ok-mx8mp-smarc-2gb.dtb, ok-mx8mp-smarc.dtb, ramdisk.img.gzto tf card.   
![Image](./images/OKMX8MPQSMARC_Linux_User_Manual/40726eb041904298822ba3fca9d50b3c.png)ramdisk.img.gz is already packaged by Forlinx, with a built-in flash script update.sh, which will be executed by default during the file system initialisation process. Users can also make their own ramdsik through tools such as busybox.   
Note: The kernel Image and dtb finally flashed into the eMMC are the ones packaged in ok8mp-linux-fs.sdcard.a. The kernel Image and dtb in the TF card are used for TF card flashing and booting. Users can also modify the flash script in ramdisk to copy the kernel Image and dtb from the tf card to the emmc after flashing the emmc.

#### 7.5.3 Flashing EMMC With TF Card

Adjust the DIP switch on the development board to TF card boot mode, insert the flashing card, and then power on the development board.   
Uboot will boot from the TF card, and if the ramdisk. img. gz is read successfully, select to boot the file system through the ramdisk. img. gz. It is written in uboot environment variable.   
The update.sh script in the /etc directory is executed after the filesystem is booted, which is used for flashing the filesystem, and a successful flash printout is shown below.

```plain
update start...
