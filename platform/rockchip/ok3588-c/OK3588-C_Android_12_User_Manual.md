## 1\. OK3588 Development Board Description

RK3588 is a low-power, high-performance processor based on ARM64 architecture, which includes 4-core Cortex-A55 and 4-core Conrtex-A76 as well as independent NEON processor and neural network processor NPU, and it can be applied to computers, cell phones, personal mobile Internet, and digital multimedia devices.

Connection method is board-to-board, and main interfaces are shown in the figure below:

![Image](./images/OK3588-C_Android_12_User_Manual/1718940820996_a38628f9_0138_444d_a602_ab3e6c492f6d.png)

**Back**

**Note: This software manual does not describe the hardware parameters. Before referring to this manual for software development, please read the "OK3588-C Hardware Manual \_ V1.0" under "Hardware Data/User Manual" (the download method is the same as the software data) to understand the product naming rules and the hardware configuration of the product, which is helpful for you to use it.**

### 1.2 CPU/GPU/NPU Frequency Description

**RK3588J industrial grade SoM frequencies are described below:**

**Note: For the industrial-grade RK3588J SoM, to better test the maximum performance of this SOC, starting from version R4 and subsequent versions, the SoM in the user materials will default to operate in overclocking mode (Without performance requirements, it is recommended to modify it to the normal mode). **

Refer to ‚ÄúRockchip RK3588J Datasheet V1.1-03/08/2023.pdf ‚Äù

Table 3-2 Recommended operating conditions

| Maximum CPU A76 frequency, normal mode ‚ë†| 1.6GHz
|----------|----------
| Maximum CPU A76 frequency, overclocking mode ‚ë°| 2.0GHz
| Maximum CPU A55 frequency, normal mode ‚ë†| 1.3GHz
| Maximum CPU A55 frequency, overclocking mode ‚ë°| 1.7GHz
| Maximum GPU frequency, normal mode ‚ë†| 700MHz
| Maximum GPU frequency, overclocking mode ‚ë°| 850MHz
| Maximum NPU frequency, normal mode ‚ë†| 800MHz
| Maximum NPU frequency, overclocking mode ‚ë°| 950MHz

1. Normal mode indicates that the chip is operating at a safe voltage and frequency. For industrial environments, it is highly recommended to keep it in normal mode to reasonably ensure longevity;
2. Overclocking mode will bring higher frequency, and the corresponding voltage will also increase. Running in overclocking mode in a long time may shorten the chip's life, especially at high temperatures.

To switch to "normal mode", you need to add # include "rk3588j.dtsi" to the reference in the kernel device tree. The path is:

OK3588-android-source/kernel-5.10/arch/arm64/boot/dts/rockchip/OK3588-C-common.dtsi

**RK3588 commercial grade SoM frequencies are described below:**

Refer to ‚ÄúRockchip RK3588 Datasheet V1.7-17/11/2023.pdf ‚Äù

Table 3-2 Recommended operating conditions

| Maximum CPU A76 frequency| 2.2-2.4 GHz
|----------|----------
| Maximum CPU A55 frequency| 1.8GHz
| Maximum GPU frequency| 1GHz
| Maximum NPU frequency| 1GHz

## 2\. Fast Startup

### **2.1 Preparation Before Startup**

The OK3588 development board has two system login methods, serial and network login. Hardware preparation before system startup:

+ 12V2A or 12V3A DC Power Cable
+ Debugging serial cable

The debug serial port on the development board is a Type-C socket, allowing users to connect the development board to a PC using a USB to Type-C cable to monitor the status of the development board.

![Image](./images/OK3588-C_Android_12_User_Manual/1.png)

### **2.2 Debugging Serial Driver Installation**

The debugging serial port of the OK3588 - C platform uses a Type - C interface. There is an on - board USB to UART chip, so there's no need to purchase a USB to serial port debugging tool. It is extremely simple and convenient to use.

To install the driver, please use the driver package DriverAssitant\_v5.1.1.zip provided in the User Profile \\Android\\Tools\\ directory.

Run DriverInstall.exe directly after the unzipping is completed; in order to ensure the driver is the latest version, please unstall the driver first, then install again.

### **2.3 Serial Port Login**

#### 2.3.1 Serial Port Connection Settings

 **Note:**

+ **Serial port terminal login user: Serial port terminal automatically logs in root user without password;**
+ **Serial port settings: baud rate 115200, data bit 8, stop bit 1, no parity bit, no flow control;**
+ **Hardware Requirements: Type-C cable required to connect PC and development boards;**
+ **Software requirements: PC Windows system needs to install the super terminal software. Because the terminal software has many types, users can choose their familiar one.**

In the following, we take the putty terminal software as an example to introduce the serial port login method:

Step 1: Connect the serial port number of the computer---check the serial port number from the device manager (Based on the port actually recognized by the computer );

![Image](./images/OK3588-C_Android_12_User_Manual/2.png)

Step 2: Open and set up putty, then set the‚Äú line according to the COM port of the computer used, baud rate 115200;

![Image](./images/OK3588-C_Android_12_User_Manual/1718940830351_944c8fb8_def2_4746_9449_2cd8763908a1.png)

Step 3: After the setting, input the COM port used by the computer in Saved Sessions. The following figure takes COM3 as an example, save the settings, open the serial port again later, and click on the saved port number;

![Image](./images/OK3588-C_Android_12_User_Manual/1718940830538_2553e7fc_b6d5_434b_ace7_7864de173fe8.png)

#### 2.3.2 Serial Login

After the terminal software on the PC side is set, connect the PC and the development board through the serial port cable, and power on after connecting the power supply. The startup information can be seen through the terminal software.

The following startup message indicates a successful start, allowing a new command line to be entered by pressing Enter:

![Image](./images/OK3588-C_Android_12_User_Manual/1718940830731_94ee0055_dc57_46dc_a75b_940b5d86a20a.png)

### **2.4 Screen Switching**

OK3588 supports various screen interfaces such as MIPI DSI, HDMI, eDP, DP, RGB, etc., and can simultaneously perform mirroring and independent display for up to four screens. Currently there are three screen switching methods: uboot menu dynamic control; kernel device tree designation; DisplayHwConfig application control.

OK3588 contains 4 display controllers, i.e. 4 VP. Supports up to 4 screens simultaneously. The maximum resolution of VP0 is 7680x4320; the maximum resolution of VP1 is 4096x4320; the maximum resolution of VP2 is 4096x4320; the maximum resolution of VP3 is 2048x1080.

#### 2.4.1 Uboot Menu Dynamic Control 

##### 2.4.1.1 Display Type Settings

This method allows switching without recompiling and burn-in of existing supported screens.

During the uboot self-boot process, press the space bar at the serial terminal to bring up the control options:

```plain
Hit key to stop autoboot('Spacebar'):  0
---------------------------------------------
0:Exit to console
1:Reboot
2:Display type
3:Android config
---------------------------------------------
```

Enter 2 at the terminal to access the Screen Control sub-menu:

```plain
---------------------------------------------
hdmi0 and edp0 share same port, only one can be used.
hdmi1 and edp1 share same port, only one can be used.
only four VPs internally, so up to four interfaces can be activated
hdmi edp dp can only be displayed on VP0 or VP1 or VP2.
dsi0 dsi1 can only be displayed on VP2 or  VP3.
rgb can only be displayed on VP3.

Select  display
  0:Exit
  1: hdmi0 => VP0
  2: hdmi1 =>
  3: edp0  =>
  4: edp1  =>
  5: dp0   =>
  6: dp1   =>
  7: mipi0 =>
  8: mipi1 =>
  9: rgb   =>
  a: primary display  => HDMI0
b: primary display resolution => 1920x1080p50
---------------------------------------------
```

According to the content of the comments in the uboot menu, you can get the uboot display menu setting rules:

1\. Both hdmi0 and edp0 use the same port, and only one of them can be used at the same time;

2\. HDMI1 and EDP1 share the same port, and only one of them can be used at a time;

3\. There are only four VPs internally, so a maximum of four interfaces can be activated;

4\. HDMI, EDP, and DP can only be displayed on VP0, VP1, or VP2;

5\. DSI0 and DSI1 can only be displayed on VP2 or VP3;

6\. RGB can only be displayed on VP3.

When setting up the display, enter the serial number corresponding to the display interface and VP will be assigned to the corresponding interface. If you input again, the system will switch the available VP (Virtual Ports) for this port one by one, or close the VP assigned to this port.

Enter a to switch the main screen display. Only the interface assigned with VP can be set as the main screen display.

**Setup Examples**:

As shown in the figure below, VP is assigned to hdmi0, hdmi1, dp0 and mipi0, so the main screen display can be selected from one of the above four interfaces. Because the HDMI interface is used, the EDP interface cannot be used. The primary display also selects HDMI0 with VP0 assigned and sets the resolution to 1920x1080.

**Note: When the primary screen is HDMI or DP, you need to set the "primary display resolution" to 3840x2160 and connect the primary screen before the device is powered on. Otherwise, connecting the main screen after startup will result in resolution switching on the secondary screen. When the main screen is EDP or MIPI, the primary display resolution option will not take effect.**

```plain
---------------------------------------------
Select  display
  0:Exit
  1: hdmi0 => VP0
  2: hdmi1 => VP1
  3: edp0  =>
  4: edp1  =>
  5: dp0   => VP2
  6: dp1   =>
  7: mipi0 => VP3
  8: mipi1 =>
  9: rgb   =>
  a: primary display  => HDMI0
b: primary display resolution => 1920x1080p50
---------------------------------------------
```

##### 2.4.1.2 Android Setting

At the top of the uboot settings menu, type 3 to go to the android settings menu bar.

```plain
---------------------------------------------
android_navigationbar==>off android_topsliding==>off android_root_access==>off
Select  android config
0:Exit
1:android navigationbar display off
2:android topsliding display off
3:android root access status off
---------------------------------------------
```

Here you can set the navigation bar, status bar, and root permissions of Android. Inputting the corresponding number can toggle the on/off status of the corresponding function.

The navigation bar display and top sliding display are set to on. After entering the system, the navigation bar and the top sliding bar will be shielded. Use the right mouse button to return to the function.

With the root access status set to on, other users can also gain root privileges at the terminal command line.

#### 2.4.2 Kernel Device Tree Specification

This method does not require the connection of a serial terminal, and the system image defaults to the desired configuration selection, which is suitable for mass production. However, we need to manually modify the device tree and regenerate the system image once again

**Note: This method has higher priority than the uboot screen selection, and the uboot selection will not take effect after the device tree is modified.**

The device tree path: kernel/arch/arm64/boot/dts/rockchip/OK3588-C-common.dtsi

In the kernel source code, open the device dtsi file and find the following node:

![Image](./images/OK3588-C_Android_12_User_Manual/1718940830946_1935c571_9a4a_436b_abc6_ddbe18e07737.png)

The node has a default disabled state and needs to be changed to an okay enabled node. Change according to screen requirements.

**Parameter Description:**

| | **Meaning**
|----------|----------
| status| Describe the node state: disabled is for off, okay is for on
| HDMI0| Specify the VP assigned to HDMI0
| HDMI1| Specify the VP assigned to HDMI1
| EDP0| Specify the VP assigned to EDP0
| EDP1| Specify the VP assigned to EDP1
| DP0| Specify the VP assigned to DP0
| DP1| Specify the VP assigned to DP1
| MIPI0| Specify the VP assigned to MIPI0
| MIPI1| Specify the VP assigned to MIPI1
| RGB| Specify the VP assigned to RGB
| primary\_display| Specify the main screen display

Users need to change the setting parameters as required. After saving, it is necessary to recompile and generate an image.

An annotated description of the node:

1\. Both hdmi0 and edp0 use the same port, and only one of them can be used at the same time;

2\. HDMI1 and EDP1 share the same port, and only one of them can be used at a time;

3\. There are only four VPs internally, so a maximum of four interfaces can be activated;

4\. HDMI, EDP, and DP can only be displayed on VP0, VP1, or VP2;

5\. DSI0 and DSI1 can only be displayed on VP2 or VP3;

6\. RGB can only be displayed on VP3.

So the optional parameters for HDMI0/1, EDP0/1, DP0/1 are "VP0", "VP1", "VP2", and "OFF";

MIPI0/1 optional parameters are: "VP2", "VP3";

The RGB optional parameter is: "VP3";

The primary\_display parameter depends on the actual display interface assigned to get the VP.

**Note: When modifying the device tree, you need to follow the annotation rules to avoid using conflicts. The driver does not detect whether the forlinx-control configuration conforms to the rules. An error in the setting will cause abnormal display.**

**For the display interface set to "OFF", blocking, deleting, or retaining is possible. It‚Äôs not necessary to set all four VP.**

**Examples**:

Assign VP0 to HDMI0, VP1 to HDMI1, VP2 unused, and VP3 for RGB use. Set the main screen to HDMI0.

![Image](./images/OK3588-C_Android_12_User_Manual/1718940831160_05a365a0_cb31_4721_8ec5_c7e9cdb3d04a.png)

After saving, recompile to generate the image.

### **2.5 System Shutdown**

In general, the power can be turned off directly. If there is data storage, function use, or other operations, avoid turning off the power arbitrarily during operation to prevent irreversible damage to the file. In such cases, only re-flashing the firmware can resolve the issue. To ensure that data is not completely written, enter the sync command to complete data synchronization before turning off the power.

**Note: For products designed based on the SoM, if there are scenarios where accidental power loss causes the system to shut down unexpectedly, measures such as adding power-loss protection can be incorporated into the design.**

Factory Tool is a factory batch OTG flashing tool, which does not need to read the image and supports large file flashing. Use this tool if RKDevTool is not compatible. Before use, you need to decompress to the full English path, connect the development board to the host, press the recovery key, press the reset key to reset, and release the recovery key after two seconds. There will be prompts on the Rockchip development tool : loader device found

**Note: The operation to recognize the device is that the recovery button should be in the pressed state when the development board is powered on. Theoretically, Rockchip development tools have no requirements for the unzip directory. However, some users have feedback that the unzip directory should be in full English. If the tool doesn't match the following figure, please consider unzipping it in an English directory.**

Open the Rockchip development tool:

### **4.2 TF Card Flashing**

TF card production, flashing and testing

**Note: The tested TF card capacity is up to 16G, using 32G and above TF card may fail to burn.**

Copy SDDiskTool\_v1.69.zip from the user profile tools directory to any directory on windows. Run SD\_Firmware\_Tool.exe with administrator privileges.

![Image](./images/OK3588-C_Android_12_User_Manual/147.png)

Select the disk device, check "Firmware Upgrade" and select update.img. Click Start Creating.

![Image](./images/OK3588-C_Android_12_User_Manual/149.png)

Insert the TF card into the development board and start, the system will automatically enter the flashing process. When the flashing is complete, both the screen and the serial port will prompt:

Please remove SD CARD!!!, wait for reboot.

At this time, pull out the TF card, the system automatically restarts (please do not power down directly).

During mass production, check the flashing status by SoM heartbeat light.  Heartbeat light modes are as follows:

1. Kernel startup phase: Heartbeat light mode, regular intermittent flashes.
2. Flashing preparation phase: EMMC indicator light, off.
3. Flashing in progress phase: EMMC indicator light, on.
4. Flashing completion phase: Heartbeat light mode, regular intermittent flashes.

Serial port information during the burning process:

If the automatic restart does not occur after removing the TF card, a manual restart can also complete the burning. Please be patient during the burning process.

## 5\. System OTA Upgrade Test

OTA (over the air) upgrade is a standard software upgrade method provided by Android system. It has powerful functions, and the current version of system OTA upgrade provides two methods of local complete package upgrade and network upgrade.

### **5.1 OTA Upgrade Package Compilation**

The OTA upgrade package can be compiled by using forlinx.sh under OK3588-android-source file, please modify the android code first, then compile the OK3588 system upgrade package:

**Note: Before compiling the OK3588 system upgrade package, make sure that the source code has been fully compiled using the./forlinx. Sh all command.**

```plain
forlinx@ubuntu20:~/OK3588-android-source$ ./forlinx.sh ota
```

Compilation process is too long, please be patient. Compilation completed firmware directory: rockdev/Image-ok3588\_c/update.zip

### **5.2 OTA Local Upgrade**

Copy the update.zip generated in the previous section to the root directory of the USB or TF card, or the /data/media/0/ directory, the system will automatically detect the upgrade package and pop up the upgrade dialogue box.

The following is done in adb mode:

```plain
adb root
adb remount
adb push updata.zip /data/media/0/
```

After waiting for a while, the interface prompts whether to install the upgrade package window.

![Image](./images/OK3588-C_Android_12_User_Manual/150.png)

Click "Installation‚Äù.

The debugging window prints the following information:

![Image](./images/OK3588-C_Android_12_User_Manual/1718940988058_b6600e05_17e9_432f_a9da_6a20ad4dd171.png)

After that, it will automatically restart and enter the Recovery system to automatically complete the OTA package upgrade. At this time, it cannot be powered off and wait for the upgrade.

When completed, it will automatically restart to the main Android interface.

After the system restarts, a dialog box pops up on the interface to prompt congratulations on the success of the upgrade.

![Image](./images/OK3588-C_Android_12_User_Manual/151.png)

Click "Yes".

Finally, you can verify that the android system has been modified.

Note: The prompt for firmware upgrade operation after the system reboot is the correct prompt because the file /data/media/0/update.zip exists, so it will wait for a few minutes to pop up the prompt. The Firmware Prompt dialog will not pop up after deleting the/data/media/0/update.zip.

### **5.3 OTA Network Upgrade**

1\. Environment Setup

Edit the device/rockchip/rk3588/device.mk file and change the server IP address via ro.product.ota.host

![Image](./images/OK3588-C_Android_12_User_Manual/1718940988672_d3ae9809_3087_4e48_9f48_81d5285cf035.png)

Execute . /for Linux.sh ota to compile the upgrade firmware, which is located at rockdev/Image-ok3588\_c/update.zip.

Extract apache-tomcat-7.0.29.tar.gz to PC Ubuntu home directory, copy update.zip to /home/forlinx/apache-tomcat-7.0.29/webapps/OtaUpdater/WEB-INF/packages/ ok3588\_c/1.0.0/1.0.1.zip

Enable apache-tomcat

```plain
cd /home/forlinx/apache-tomcat-7.0.29
./bin/startup.sh
```

Disable apache-tomcat

```plain
./bin/shutdown.sh
```

2\. Network Upgrade Test
